1) fix problem when deploy on ubuntu allowing users to create filesystem permission:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/703672/permission-denied-when-writing-a-file-to-new-filesystem
-> go to level same as uploads folder and input:
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./uploads


2) allow npm to force install node-Sass:
https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2178
bash: npm install --unsafe-perm=true

    * We are at the Develop Branch
    -> added new feature!
    -> spliting develop branch again

3) create symbolic link from outside project folder uploads to inside project folder

4) For deployment, delete /dist at Angular/.gitignore
    -> add back /dist during development
